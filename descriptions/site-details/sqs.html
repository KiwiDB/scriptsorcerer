			 I designed and implemented this backend workflow for use on marketing microsites developed by the Media Services team at Hobsons. The system allows the contact form submission to be loosely coupled from the submission of these contacts to various external endpoints. Submission from the microsite produces an item in an AWS SQS queue; a separate process monitors and reads items from the queue when available, and uses client-specific configuration files (JSON files) to integrate with external systems as needed. Many types of data validation is done during the submission process, pulling their requirements from the client configuration file. System health checks are also performed, with alert emails notifying the system administrators of any system faults or contact data issues.
