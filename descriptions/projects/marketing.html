			In 2013 I joined the Media Services team (a digital marketing team) at Hobsons, as developer. When I took over, the state of the technology on the team was fairly underdeveloped. Over the course of a few months I introduced some significant improvements to the infrastructure:

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Design Team</strong> Together with the team leadership, we introduced a true design team to the mix. These were junior designers from elsewhere in the company (who, until this point, concentrated on print design). I worked with them to teach web design concepts.</li>

				<li><strong>Website Frontend</strong> I joined at a time when our portfolio of sites were being moved to a new server and the CMS (Joomla) was being upgraded simultaneously. This provided me an opprotunity to rebuild most of our sites from the ground up. I completly restructued the internal Joomla archetecture, adding modules, template concepts, and custom menu item types. I also rebuilt the frontend, adding Twitter Bootstrap and LESS CSS to the mix. Together with the design team, we made our sites fully responsive.</li>
				<li><strong>Website Backend</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Submission Handler</strong></li>
			</ul>
